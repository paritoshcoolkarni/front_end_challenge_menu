##Front end challenge : Lesson Menu


In this challenge, you will create a lesson navigation menu.

<b>Description:</b><br>
The menu will contain title blocks for 12 weeks of a course (plus an intro week) with subtopics for each week listed below the title of the week. You may use any text for the subtopics. There will be 3 title blocks visible at any given time. When the left or right arrow buttons are clicked, the title blocks will move left or right to reveal the next or previous set of 3 title blocks. Your menu should loosely visually match menu_screenshot.png (don't worry about exact colors, sizes, or fonts). Use of jQuery is allowed/encouraged.

<b>For bonus points:</b><br>
Prevent the title blocks from scrolling out of view.<br>
Disable the arrow buttons when the title blocks are all the way to the left or right.<br>
Animate the transitions.

<b>For super bonus points:</b><br>
Make the menu responsive by having 1 visible title block at a time instead of 3 at the media query breakpoint given in style.css.
